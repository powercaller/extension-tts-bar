***important:*** the stop button will not work without modification to the source files, due to how the original tts extension is built. it will try to autoplay if stop is pressed. pause works fine, but i recommend just carefully modifying the source files. instructions in the discord post. DM me if any issues or need help!


Update 0.2 -> added volume controls. id imagine this is pretty bad on mobile! not meant for mobile. but u can try it...


This has no settings. Colors are fixed, and was built using a specific theme (that's close to the original). Haven't tested with other themes or layouts. If you're using anything close to original - it should work.

The bar will appear when there's TTS to play back. It only operates on the *last/currently loaded TTS file*  - there is no playlist or anything. maybe i'll do that later but it will be complicated.

features:

play/pause/seek/download.

speed changes - minimum 0.9, maximum 1.10. 

stuff i'll do if i feel like it:

better theme compatibility
more granular speed control (slider)
playlist/audio file selector
